  <h2>How to use the journal</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start small.</strong> Commit to two weeks. A few minutes morning and night is enough.</li>
    <li><strong>Notice your body.</strong> Ask: <em>Is there any part of my body in pain?</em> and take small action if you can.</li>
    <li><strong>Set 3 priorities.</strong> Each morning write 3–4 things you want to get done in the next eight hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Reflect kindly.</strong> At night, notice what made you mad, why, and what you can do tomorrow to make things a little better.</li>
    <li><strong>Look for patterns.</strong> After a week, re‑read your answers and notice small changes. Progress is often quiet.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="note">This practice is less about perfection and more about presence. Keep your answers short — write the first things that come to mind.</p>

    <li>Group journaling circles — guided two‑week groups to build the habit together.</li>
    <li>Short coaching sessions — practical conversations to help you turn insights into action.</li>
  </ul>
