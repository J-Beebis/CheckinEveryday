# Check In, Everyday — Static site


This repo contains a simple static site built to showcase the "Check In, Everyday" 2‑week journal and the related coaching/consulting services.


## Files
- `index.html` — main landing page (hero, book preview, services summary, contact form)
- `services.html` — details about coaching, workshops, and business offerings
- `styles.css` — site styles
- `script.js` — small interactive enhancements
- `assets/Check-In--Everyday-2-week-journal.pdf` — (copy of the PDF you provided)
- `assets/cover-thumb.png` — small thumbnail for the cover (replace with your own cover image)


## How to publish
1. Create a new GitHub repo and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. In the repo Settings → Pages, serve from `main` / root. The site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.


## Notes & next steps
- Replace `assets/cover-thumb.png` with a high‑quality image of your cover.
- Update the contact form action to point at your email handler or a service like Formspree / Netlify Forms.
- If you want a React or Next.js version, tell me and I will generate it.
