# Check In, Everyday — Static site (Journal-first)


This repo is focused on the 2‑Week Journal "Check In, Everyday" by Jesur Habek. The site centers the book's voice and practice; coaching and services are listed only as optional supports.


## Files
- `index.html` — main landing page (gentle introduction, how to use, PDF preview)
- `services.html` — optional offerings (external booking links)
- `privacy.html` — privacy policy (no data collected)
- `styles.css` — site styles
- `script.js` — small UX enhancements
- `assets/` — place the journal PDF and cover image here


## Publishing
1. Create a GitHub repo and push these files to `main`.
2. Add the files in `assets/`:
- `Check-In--Everyday-2-week-journal.pdf` (your PDF)
- `cover-thumb.png` (cover thumbnail)
3. Configure GitHub Pages to serve from `main`/root.


## Notes
- No forms or analytics are included. All bookings and purchases link to external sites.
- If you'd like a ZIP, React/Next version, or small visual tweaks (fonts/colors extracted from the PDF), tell me and I will prepare the next step.
